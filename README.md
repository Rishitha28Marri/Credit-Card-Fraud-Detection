# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model uses a dataset of credit card transactions labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent to train a predictive model.

The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions with the following features:

Time: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1, V2, ..., V28: Anonymous features obtained by PCA transformation for confidentiality purposes.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: The class label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

The credit card fraud detection model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results will be printed in the console and can be further analyzed to assess the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.
